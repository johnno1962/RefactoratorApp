# Refactorator II, The App

This is the source for the App version of the [Refactorator plugin](https://github.com/johnno1962/Refactorator)
for refactoring Swift (well, renaming actually.)

One of the features of app is it can convert a project into a standalone website of navigable code for
example [this project](http://johnholdsworth.com/refactorator).

To build, clone this and the code for the Refactorator plugin next to each other the build this project.
Help is available [here](http://johnholdsworth.com/refactorator.html) where you can download a [pre-built
binary](http://johnholdsworth.com/Refactorator.app.zip).

The project now draws interactive dependecncy graphs between sources in a project if you have Graphviz installed.
