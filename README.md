# Refactorator II, The App

Due to chnages in the index databaase format in Xcode 10, this program no longer works properly.

This is the source for the App version of the [Refactorator plugin](https://github.com/johnno1962/Refactorator)
for refactoring Swift (well, renaming actually.)

One of the features of app is it can convert a project into a standalone website of navigable code for
example [this project](http://johnholdsworth.com/refactorator).

To build, clone this *and the code for the Refactorator plugin* next to each other the build this project.
Help is available [here](http://johnholdsworth.com/refactorator.html) where you can download a [pre-built
binary](http://johnholdsworth.com/Refactorator.app.zip).

The project now draws interactive dependecncy graphs between sources in a project if you have Graphviz installed.

Refactorator now takes into account membership of protocols and overrides in the main target
if you augment the index db by using the "File/Index Protocols" menu item.

This project is an experiment in "Beerware" there is a "donate" button on the Help Menu ;)
